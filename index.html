<h1>Happy November Ending</h1>

<div id="magic">
November is the month where time stands still</div>

<div id="loser">
Sure there's Thanksgiving, but it's just an okay holiday</div>

<div id="holiday">
November is also the start of Christmas season</div>

<div id="kapow">
Which only makes it much more satisfying that November is almost over</div>

<div id="rainbow">
Because now we can finally get to the real Christmas month</div>

<div id="faboo">
So happy November ending</div>
